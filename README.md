## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Back-end developer who has just completed cs50py, a skill building program.
I enjoy learnng new ways to improve my skills, expand and developing new project that can help out my comunity.


## Lessons Learned

I learned how to apply other function I had no idea of using, style coding, how to shorten my code. This helped me text how much I know and what I still need to know.
